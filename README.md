# bare_metal_bluepill

This repository is a self learning exercise on the stm32 bluepill. The goal is to gradually explore, include and modify the [libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3) codebase as needed. The project structure is as follows:

- `libopencm3/` - The full libopencm3 library clone.
- `project_code/` - The project code, which will heavily use libopencm3 code, adding it piece by piece (and possibly modifying it here and there) as functionality is needed.
